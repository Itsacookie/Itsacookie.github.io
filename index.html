a bird story <br>
  It's a nice small mostly visual game. You can move around and do other things sometimes but are mostly watching the game play out. The music is very appropriate and calming.
</p>
<p>
a raven monologue <br>
A little hard to understand if you have never seen anything like it before but holds a lot of meaning once you look into it a little more. Has peaceful music that sounds good.
